Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository focuses on several initial level Machine Learning/Deep Learning projects. This projects helps in understanding the fundamentals of Machne Learning and Deep Learning, with data augmentation, preprocessing etc.

This project has wide applications in real world as each of this project is an abstract of real world problems.
Projects includes:
1) Bird Species Prediction: A classification project that utilizes Bird Image Data and classify them into labels by utilizing CNN models. For real world application, this project can be utilized by integrating with advanced drones, that'll classify Animals with other unwanted things in sky
2) Cars Detection: This project will count the number of cars available in an image captured. This can be utilized in further application in traffic system, by generating automatic images and capturing if a traffic rule is being broken by a certain car or not.
3) Dog Breed Prediction: This is quite similer to Birds Prediction.
4) Image Watermarking: To add a watermark in an image for copyright issues.
5) Pancard Tempering: Classify real and tempered pan card from preventing unauthorized access of an individual on a specific event.
6) Text Extractor: Extracting Text Data from image by using pytesseract, this is NLP based project.
7) Traffic Signal Classification: Similer to bird and dog, this is again a classification approach to classify images.
